# Lame Tank

![](lame-tank.jpg)

Not a real game. Just a demo project/repo for my tutorial on on-onscreen game controller for Flame.

Tutorial: https://jap.alekhin.io/onscreen-gamepad-controller-flame

**Feel free to build upon it!**

*(or use it to learn game development and make your own game)*

If you do build upon this project, crediting back to this repo or [my website](https://jap.alekhin.io), would be appreciated. **Although it's not required.** What's more important though is to send me a link to what you made. It makes me happy when people learn and create something out of my projects and tutorials.
